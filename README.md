drools-jsr303
=============

Business rules validation of Java objects using Drools, JSR303 and Spring. This code is based on my original [blog post](http://nonrepeatable.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/rules-based-validation-using-drools.html) from years ago. Someone asked me if the code was in GitHub - it is now :-)

Note that the example model classes, rules and configuration are in `src/test` while the `@BusinessRulesConstraint` and `BusinessRulesConstraintValidator` are in `src/main/java`.
